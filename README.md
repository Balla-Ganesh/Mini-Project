 Headerfile for Single linked list
A headerfile for Single Linked List is created which can perform some basic operations.
This helps in writing the complex code everytime. 
This is just made to easy the writing of large complex codes always, but knowing the logic and implementation is a best thing.

The functions includes:
       > beginInsert
       > lastInsert
       > locInsert
       > beginDelete
       > lastDelete
       > locDelete
       > display
       > makeCycle
       > isCycle
       > removeCycle
       > Size
       > reverse
       > isKey
       > isSorted
       > getHead
       > intersect
       > isConnected
       > sort
